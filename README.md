# C compiler

For now, only the C preprocessor is implemented.

## Missing in the preprocessor

- Evaluation of character constant in `#if`/`#elif` expression.
- Wide char and string.
- Universal Character Set.

## Wish

- Rewrite in C++. Reason? Just want to focus on the compiler logic itself not
  stuff like hash table, vector, etc.
