1. Recognize source character set, also replace newline in source code to
   the host newline (e.g. \r\n become \n). If trigraphs exist, replace them
   into their alternative forms. And last, merge line continuation.
2. Preprocessor executed. When #include encountered, scan the included file
   from the phase 1.
3. Concat adjacent string literals.
4. Actual compilation; Parsing, Analysis, Optimizations and Codegen.
